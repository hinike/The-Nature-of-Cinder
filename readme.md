# THE NATURE OF CINDER

An adoptation of Daniel Shiffman's [text](http://natureofcode.com/book) towards establishing a Creative-Coding workflow with [Cinder](http://libcinder.org).

(Cinder 0.8.5 / XCode 5.1.1 / [Wiki](https://github.com/ilzxc/The-Nature-of-Cinder/wiki) has some content.)

(I *am* planning to upgrade the whole thing for `0.8.6` and provide Visual Studio projects as soon as I can set a little time aside.)

It's been a while, but there are still some outstanding bits of code in Chapter 9 that I've been particularly partial to when I first read Shiffman's book. I'll try to get to it soon.
